% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we consider improving convolution neural network (CNN) classifier of offline handwritten text.  
  We focus on the style of handwriting each of the individual users, causing of its great variability and huge impact on the ability to successfully recognize written characters. 
  We present fast, scalable and a no-retrain method for improving CNNs classifier. 
  Using only basic machine learning techniques, such as K nearest neighbor classifier and K means clustering, we achieve up to +2.7\% improvement in neural classifier precision, and get state of the art results on the dataset we use. 
  We evaluate our method on two dataset: NIST Special Database 19 and ETH Zurich Deepwriting dataset.

\section{Introduction}
The problem of automatic recognition of offline handwritten characters is a very practical problem, which is a part of the area of pattern recognition. 
Inspired by practical use, it develops both within academia as well as within the industrial sector. 
The industrial sector directly commercializes solutions of this problem by including them into devices like tablets, smartphones and the like. 
That is why it is very important to have precise classifiers that rarely make mistakes.
